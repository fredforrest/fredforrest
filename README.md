- ⚡ Fun fact: I am educated as a physical therapist. I finished my masters in 2020 at University of Southeren Denmark, with a thesis investigating lower back pain in sedentary vs. heavy labour work forces. I recently changed my career to follow my dream of working in IT. Furthermore, I have an identical twin brother ;-)
